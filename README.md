# PyTorch Binary and Multiclass Classification with Custom Dataset Generator

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of binary and multiclass classification using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The classification task is performed on a custom dataset generated by a custom dataset generator.

## Description
The primary goal of this project is to showcase the process of training and evaluating classification models using PyTorch on a custom dataset. The custom dataset generator is designed to create synthetic data points, allowing for flexibility in generating different types of data distributions and patterns.

### Dataset Generation
The custom dataset generator included in this project employs the scikit-learn library to generate synthetic data points. It offers the ability to generate data points arranged in concentric circles, similar to the scikit-learn's `make_circles` function. However, in this project, we have modified the generator to allow for overlapping data points with small random variations. Additionally, the generator provides the option to assign class labels to the data points based on a selected color. Each color represents a different class, enabling multiclass classification tasks.

### Binary and Multiclass Classification
The generated dataset is then used to train and evaluate binary and multiclass classification models using PyTorch. Binary classification refers to the task of classifying data into two distinct classes, while multiclass classification involves classifying data into multiple classes. This project demonstrates how to handle both scenarios using PyTorch's deep learning capabilities.

To perform classification, the project employs neural network models built with PyTorch. The models consist of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers, which are trained using labeled data generated by the custom dataset generator. The models are trained using popular optimization techniques like gradient descent and backpropagation, and evaluated on test data to measure their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
